### FlySpeed
Created by [AndurilUnlogic](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/andurilunlogic.466839/).
Original [spigot resource page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/flyspeed-1-8-1-19.48231/). 

This repository exists to fix a bug in the original plugin where /walkspeed <number> <playerName> did not check permissions.
This caused any player to be able to change the walk speed of any other player.

The original plugin author was contacted on spigot and discord to try and get an update for this bug released.
